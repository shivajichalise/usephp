For the current user:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivajichalise/usephp/main/usephp > ~/usr/local/bin/usephp && chmod +x ~/usr/local/bin/usephp
```

Or simply copy the `usephp` file to a location in your `$PATH` and make it executable.

## Usage

- run `usephp 7` for choosing php7

## How it works

all it does is symlinks the desired php from /usr/bin into our /usr/local/bin/
